README
* Notice
    Frontend (javascript and css) is adapted according to the tutorial: 
    http://tutorialzine.com/2010/03/ajax-todo-list-jquery-php-mysql-css/
    I use normally dojo instead of jquery for the work.

* Install
** copy the source code to a vhost and set public direcotry as the root directory
** Create and initialize database
    A ant task could be used to create database and insert the public points
    and test user. The test username and password are 'amdin'

*** config database
    >vi build.property
    > .... config your database info
    >cd deployment
    >ant init
** Config database
    Config your database info in applicaton/config/applicaiton.ini, according
    to the database info in build.property
